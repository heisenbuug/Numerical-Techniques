## Bisection Method
The bisection method in mathematics is a root-finding method that repeatedly bisect an interval and then selects a subinterval in which a root must lie for further processing. It is a very simple and robust method, but it is also relatively slow. Because of this, it is often used to obtain a rough approximation to a solution which is then used as a starting point for more rapidly converging methods. The method is also called the interval halving method, the binary search method, or the dichotomy method.

The method is applicable for solving the equation f(x) = 0 for the real variable x, where f is a continuous function defined on an interval [a, b] and f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs. The continuous function f must have at least one root in the interval (a, b).

At each step the method divides the interval in two by computing the midpoint
c = (a+b) / 2 of the interval and the value of the function f(c) at that point. Hence the name.
