## Lagranges Interpolation

This is again an Nth degree polynomial approximation formula to the function f(x), which is known at discrete points xi, i = 0, 1, 2 . . . Nth. The formula can be derived from the Vandermonds determinant but a much simpler way of deriving this is from Newton's divided difference formula. If f(x) is approximated with an Nth degree polynomial then theNth divided difference of f(x) constant and (N+1)th divided difference is zero.
