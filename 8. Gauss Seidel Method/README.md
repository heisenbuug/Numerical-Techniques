## Gauss Seidel Method 

In numerical linear algebra, the Gaussâ€“Seidel method, also known as the Liebmann method or the method of successive displacement, is an iterative method used to solve a linear system of equations.

With the Gauss Seidel method, on the other hand, you use the new values of each as soon as they are known. That is, once you have determined from the first equation, its value is then used in the second equation to obtain the new Similarly, the new and are used in the third equation to obtain the new and so on.
