## Newton F&B Interpolation

Interpolation is the process of approximating a given function, whose values are known at N+1 tabular points, by a suitable polynomial, PN(X), of degree N which takes the values Yi at X=Xi for i=0,1,2,..N Note that if the given data has errors, it will also be reflected in the polynomial so obtained. These interpolation methods works only for evenly spaced x values.
