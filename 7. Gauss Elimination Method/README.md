## Gauss Elimination Method

Gaussian elimination. In linear algebra, Gaussian elimination (also known as row reduction) is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. It is usually understood as a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients.T

he Given Linear System is converted to Upper Triangular System by elimination of variables.
The Upper Triangular System then solved by Backward Substitution.
Consider the following System having 3 Unknowns.
