## What is error?
Numerical Error is the error in the numerical computations, difference between the value which has been computed and 
the correct value.

## What are types of error?
There are two types of error: -
1.Truncation error 
2.Round off error

## What are other errors?
1.Absolute Error
2.Relative Error
3.Percentage Relative Error

## What is absolute error?
Absolute Error is the amount of error in your measurements. It is the difference between the measured value and “true” value. 
AE = |measurement – true value|

## What is relative error?
Relative error when used as a measure of precision is the ratio of the absolute error of a measurement to the measurement being taken.
RE = absolute error / |measurement being taken|

## What is % relative error?
RE = (absolute error / measurement being taken) x 100
